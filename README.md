# BlockLists

NetmanageIT Custom Blocklists from our custom Threat platform 

Two main lists I will be updating at least once a day.

These blocklists are currated from our custom Threat Platform and pulls from many high quality threat providers and feeds.

They can be used with Firewalls, DNS protection etc.
